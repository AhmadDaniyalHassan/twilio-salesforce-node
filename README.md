# Twilio ‚Äì Salesforce Middleware Integration

This project integrates **Twilio** (voice calls) with **Salesforce** (case management) through a backend middleware built with **Node.js + Express**.  

The system automatically creates Salesforce cases when a call is made or received via Twilio, prevents duplicate cases by phone number, and updates the case status based on the call lifecycle. An IVR flow is also included for basic call routing.

üì° API Endpoints
POST /call

Trigger an outbound call.

Request body:

{ "to": "+92XXXXXXXXXX" }

Handles inbound calls and plays IVR menu.

POST /gather

Processes IVR input (e.g., press 1 for Sales, 2 for Support).

POST /status

Twilio sends call lifecycle updates here. Updates Salesforce case status.

üß™ Testing

Use Postman to test /call, /voice, and /gather endpoints.

Use ngrok or deploy the server to provide Twilio with a public URL.

Check Salesforce Cases tab to confirm:

New cases are created on calls

Status updates correctly (New, In Progress, Closed)

Phone number appears in Supplied Phone field

üìå Notes

Duplicate cases are prevented using the caller‚Äôs phone number.

Salesforce stores the phone number in the Supplied Phone field.

The IVR flow can be extended for more options (e.g., departments, agent routing).
